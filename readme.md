<h1 align="center">Wine Quality Prediction</h1>

Wine Quality Prediction is a Random Forest model used for classifying the quality of wine with the help of various attributes such as alcohol, density, pH, and many more.

## Description
The problem statement identifies the requirement of a system to develop a model that identifies the quality of wine by taking various parameters into consideration such as alcohol level in the wine, color of the wine, amount of citric acid and much more.

## Dataset
The data for performing ML tasks is extracted from UCI Machine Learning repository. [(Dataset)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)

It consists of .csv files for white and red color wine.

## Libraries Involved
* __NumPy__
* __Pandas__
* __Matplotlib__
* __Seaborn__
* __Pickle__
* __Gunicorn__
* __Flask__

All the relevant libraries is already included in requirements.txt file.

## Deployment Guide
The model is deployed on Heroku with the help of flask web framework.

1) After creating and saving the model, create **Procfile** which specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup. **Procfile** is simple text file with name **'Procfile'** without any file extension.
2) Create **requirements.txt** file which includes all the libraries used in the project. It is must to include all the libraries in the **requirements.txt** file.

(P.S. -  For non-human creatures, **wine** is an alcoholic drink that is made up of fermented grapes. :robot: :alien:)
